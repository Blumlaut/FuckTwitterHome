# FuckTwitterHome
FuckTwitterHome - Automatically disables Algorithmic Timeline in favour of latest tweets first.

Userscript to attempt to prevent Twitter from constantly resetting your timeline to their "curated" garbage.

Tested on Firefox 98.0a1 (2022-01-15) with Tampermonkey 4.13.6136, Twitter.com with `en` locale set.


this is more of a learning excercise on my part, you should probably use something more popular that's less likely to break.
